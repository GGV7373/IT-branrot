                <h2>Python for Beginners: How to Not Totally Wreck Your Computer</h2>
                <p>
                    Welcome, fearless keyboard warrior, to the magical kingdom of Python!  
                    The language so friendly even your grandma could (probably) use it to summon cute cat pictures.  
                    But before you start coding like a mad scientist, here’s how to NOT accidentally vaporize your entire system. Yes, seriously — don’t be that person.
                </p>

                <h3>Warning: The Forbidden Command — Do NOT Try This at Home</h3>
                <p>
                    Just for laughs, here’s what <em>NOT</em> to do if you want to keep your computer alive:
                </p>
                <pre><code>
                    import os
                    # WARNING: THIS WILL RUIN YOUR DAY (and your whole computer)
                    os.rmdir("C:/Windows/System32")
                </code></pre>
                <p>
                    <strong>DO NOT RUN THIS.</strong>  
                    This command tries to delete the System32 folder, which is basically the beating heart of your Windows OS.  
                    Run this and your PC will throw a digital tantrum, crash spectacularly, and never forgive you.
                </p>

                <h3>1. Installing Python: Easier Than Rocket Science, But Still Pay Attention</h3>
                <p>
                    Go to python.org, grab the latest version, and hit install.  
                    If a scary popup asks you to “modify system files,” don’t just click “Yes” like it’s a game show buzzer — your PC might start crying, and not the good kind.
                </p>

                <h3>2. Running Your First Program: Hello, World! (Not Goodbye, System32)</h3>
                <p>
                    Open your favorite text editor or IDE, type <code>print("Hello, World!")</code>, and hit run.  
                    Congratulations! You just blew up… nothing. This is the only explosion allowed today.
                </p>

                <h3>3. Variables: Your Computer’s Little Sticky Notes</h3>
                <p>
                    Variables are like sticky notes for your code — they remind your computer what’s what.  
                    Just don’t name one <code>do_not_touch</code> and then proceed to touch it anyway. That’s programmer logic right there.
                </p>

                <h3>4. Loops: Making Your Computer Do the Same Thing Over and Over (Without Losing Its Mind)</h3>
                <p>
                    Loops are like that one friend who tells the same story repeatedly until you say “stop already!”  
                    Beware infinite loops — they’re the clingy ex of programming: annoying, relentless, and definitely unwanted.
                </p>

                <h3>5. Importing Modules: Summoning Your Python Minions (Not a Call for Digital Mayhem)</h3>
                <p>
                    Python’s got a whole squad of modules you can bring in for backup — like calling in the Avengers, but nerdier.  
                    Just don’t import shady or sketchy stuff unless you want your PC to call the cyber police on you.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> No matter how tempting, do NOT Google “how to delete System32.”  
                    Your computer will hate you, your memes will vanish into the void, and you’ll earn a permanent spot in the IT-Brainrot Hall of Shame.
