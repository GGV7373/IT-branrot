                <h2>Cybersecurity: Not Just for Paranoid People</h2>
                <p>
                    In a world where your fridge can be hacked and your memes can be leaked, cybersecurity is more important than ever.
                    Whether you're a casual browser or a professional meme hoarder, here's what you need to know to keep your digital life (mostly) safe.
                </p>
                <h3>Password: Your Dog's Name Isn't a Password, It's a Cry for Help</h3>
                <p>
                    Forget using "Fluffy123" as your password. If your password is easier to guess than your Netflix password,
                    you're basically handing your account to hackers on a silver platter.
                </p>
                <h3>Updates: Click "Remind Me Later" and Welcome the Digital Apocalypse</h3>
                <p>
                    Every time you ignore that update, a hacker somewhere high-fives their friends.
                    Just click the dang button and save yourself the drama.
                </p>
                <h3>Suspicious Links: No, That Nigerian Prince Isn't Real</h3>
                <p>
                    If you get an email promising cash from a stranger, congratulations — you're officially being scammed.
                    Don't be that person who falls for it twice.
                </p>
                <h3>Backups: Because Crying Over Lost Files Isn't a Hobby</h3>
                <p>
                    Losing your data is the adult version of losing your homework.
                    Backup like your sanity depends on it — spoiler: it kinda does.
                </p>
                <h3>Two-Factor Authentication: The Digital Bouncer You Didn't Know You Needed</h3>
                <p>
                    Yes, it's annoying. Yes, it's extra work. But think of 2FA as the bouncer who keeps sketchy logins out of your digital party.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Bottom line:</strong> You don't have to be a hacker to stay safe online.
                    Just use common sense, keep things updated, and don't trust anyone who says they're a prince.
