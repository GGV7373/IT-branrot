               <h2>AI: Hype vs. Reality (Because Your Fridge Isn’t Sentient… Yet)</h2>
                <p>
                    Artificial Intelligence is everywhere: in your phone, your fridge, your vacuum — and possibly conspiring with your smart toaster to burn your breakfast.  
                    But is AI really the genius overlord sci-fi promised? Or is it just an overconfident intern with Wi-Fi?
                </p>

                <h3>The Hype: Robots Will Replace Us All (Except Karen From Accounting)</h3>
                <p>
                    According to the internet, AI is about to take your job, your car, your identity, and possibly your dating profile.  
                    Every other week it’s writing screenplays, composing symphonies, and beating humans at chess, poker, and competitive Sudoku.  
                    Basically, it's Skynet... but with Grammarly.
                </p>

                <h3>The Reality: Still Fails at Captchas and Thinks You’re a Stop Sign</h3>
                <p>
                    Sure, AI can write you a love poem in Klingon, but ask it to solve a CAPTCHA and it panics.  
                    It’s not magic — it’s glorified autocomplete with an existential crisis.  
                    Also, still confused between muffins and small dogs. Relatable.
                </p>

                <h3>What AI Can Actually Do (When It’s Not Having an Identity Crisis)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Write eerily formal emails that sound like they’re from your boss’s clone</li>
                    <li>Recommend music you skipped in 2008</li>
                    <li>Dominate in chess, but lose all dignity in Mario Kart</li>
                    <li>Create memes that are either genius or absolute fever dreams — no in-between</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>What AI Can’t (Yet) Do</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Detect sarcasm — which is tragic, honestly</li>
                    <li>Make your coffee right (still waiting on a barista bot update)</li>
                    <li>Replace your IT guy who speaks only in sighs and cables</li>
                    <li>Take over the world… unless you count your Google Home turning on at 3am</li>
                </ul>

                <hr>

                <p>
                    <strong>Bottom line:</strong> AI is impressive, but it’s not your new overlord (yet).  
                    Enjoy the hype, laugh at the glitches, and remember: if it starts calling you “meat unit,” maybe unplug it for a bit.
